//NOTE: Switching from clock A to clock B requires that clock A continue to operate for at least a few cycles. If clock A stops immediately, the design sticks. The select signals are implemented as a “one-hot” control in this example, but you can use other encoding if you prefer. The input side logic is asynchronous and is not critical. This design can tolerate extreme glitching during the switch process.
